This repository contains downloadable archives of Cufflinks tools compatible with the Bioinformatics Toolbox for MATLAB.

# What is Cufflinks?
Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.

The project is now maintained by Cole Trapnell's lab at the University of Washington. For more details, visit the project page at http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/.
